# bash-birthday

This is a simple script to show you birthdays and celebrations on the terminal. I set it up to display the ones for today and for tomorrow. 

## Adding birthdays

Open the file 'birthdays.text' and add new people in the following way:

'''firstname lastname,12-31'''

I used the month-day version because I prefer the 'YYYY-MM-DD' version. Without 'YYYY' you end up with 'MM-DD'

## Adding celebrations

Open the file 'celebrations.text' and add new celebrations in the following way:

'''Festival name,12-31'''
